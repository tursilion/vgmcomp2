Except as required by other licenses, all code in this VGMComp2 is hereby released to the Public Domain.

The original author disclaims all responsibility and all liability for this software, in return, you
are free to use it for any purpose your greedy little paws desire. ;)

But, if you care to give me a thanks in your production, "Tursi" will do. ;)

Current Exceptions:

    Players/PCAY and the resulting PCAY.exe are required to be licensed as GPL version 2, because GPL trumps all.
    You'll find the required "COPYING" file in that folder. This was because I didn't want to write an AY chip 
    emulator. 
    
    Players/PCSID and the resulting PCSID.exe are required to be licensed as GPL version 2, because GPL trumps all.
    You'll find the required "COPYING" file in that folder. This was because I didn't want to write a SID chip 
    emulator.

    That said, the CPlayer files are therefore dual licensed - GPLv2 when part of PCAY or PCSID and Public 
    Domain when they are not. :p
